# FFPP 
This python app utilizes TwitterAPI and Alchemy Api to make predictions about different fantasy players. 
When you enter the name of a football player, it will retrieve tweets and tell you how people from twitter
feel about that player for the upcoming week.

Run it by executing the ffp.py script and then open up a local server to view the index.html
